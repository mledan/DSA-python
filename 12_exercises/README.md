## ðŸŽ¯ YOUR TASK: Complete Part 1 - Array Exercises

### **What You Need to Do:**

1. **Create the exercises file** (`12_exercises/array_exercises.py`)
2. **Write comprehensive tests** (`12_exercises/tests/test_array_exercises.py`)
3. **Test your implementation**
4. **Commit and push to your branch**

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

#### **Step 1: Create the Array Exercises File**
Create `12_exercises/array_exercises.py` with these components:

**Required Functions:**
- `two_sum(nums, target)` - Find two numbers that add up to target
- `max_subarray(nums)` - Find maximum sum of contiguous subarray
- `rotate_array(nums, k)` - Rotate array to the right by k steps
- `product_except_self(nums)` - Return array where each element is product of all others

**Key Requirements:**
- Include docstrings with complexity analysis
- Handle edge cases properly
- Optimize for time and space complexity
- Follow coding interview best practices

#### **Step 2: Write Tests**
Create `12_exercises/tests/test_array_exercises.py` with test cases for:
- Normal problem solutions
- Edge cases (empty arrays, single elements)
- Performance verification

#### **Step 3: Test Your Code**
```bash
# Run your exercises
python 12_exercises/array_exercises.py

# Run your tests
python -m pytest 12_exercises/tests/test_array_exercises.py -v
```

#### **Step 4: Commit and Push**
```bash
git checkout -b topic-12-exercises-arrays
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement array coding exercises

- Add Two Sum problem solution
- Implement Maximum Subarray (Kadane's Algorithm)
- Add Rotate Array solution
- Implement Product of Array Except Self"

git push origin topic-12-exercises-arrays
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- âœ… All exercises solved correctly
- âœ… Tests pass (including edge cases)
- âœ… Optimal time and space complexity
- âœ… Clean, readable code
- âœ… Ready for PR creation
