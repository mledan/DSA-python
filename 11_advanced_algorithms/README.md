## üéØ YOUR TASK: Complete Part 1 - Dynamic Programming

### **What You Need to Do:**

1. **Create the DP file** (`11_advanced_algorithms/dynamic_programming.py`)
2. **Write comprehensive tests** (`11_advanced_algorithms/tests/test_dp.py`)
3. **Test your implementation**
4. **Commit and push to your branch**

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

#### **Step 1: Create the Dynamic Programming File**
Create `11_advanced_algorithms/dynamic_programming.py` with these components:

**Required Functions:**
- `fibonacci_memoization(n)` - Fibonacci with memoization
- `fibonacci_tabulation(n)` - Fibonacci with tabulation
- `longest_common_subsequence(str1, str2)` - LCS problem
- `edit_distance(str1, str2)` - Edit distance problem
- `coin_change(coins, amount)` - Coin change problem

**Required Classes:**
- `DynamicProgramming` class for DP utilities

**Key Requirements:**
- Implement both memoization and tabulation
- Include docstrings with complexity analysis
- Handle edge cases properly
- Show time/space tradeoffs

#### **Step 2: Write Tests**
Create `11_advanced_algorithms/tests/test_dp.py` with test cases for:
- Normal DP problem solutions
- Edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values)
- Performance comparisons

#### **Step 3: Test Your Code**
```bash
# Run your DP implementation
python 11_advanced_algorithms/dynamic_programming.py

# Run your tests
python -m pytest 11_advanced_algorithms/tests/test_dp.py -v
```

#### **Step 4: Commit and Push**
```bash
git checkout -b topic-11-advanced-algorithms-dp
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement dynamic programming algorithms

- Add memoization and tabulation techniques
- Implement classic DP problems (Fibonacci, LCS, Edit Distance)
- Add coin change problem solution
- Include performance comparisons"

git push origin topic-11-advanced-algorithms-dp
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ All DP algorithms work correctly
- ‚úÖ Tests pass (including edge cases)
- ‚úÖ Proper memoization and tabulation implementation
- ‚úÖ Docstrings include complexity analysis
- ‚úÖ Ready for PR creation
