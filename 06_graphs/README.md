## ðŸŽ¯ YOUR TASK: Complete Part 1 - Graph Representation

### **What You Need to Do:**

1. **Create the graph file** (`06_graphs/graph.py`)
2. **Write comprehensive tests** (`06_graphs/tests/test_graph.py`)
3. **Test your implementation**
4. **Commit and push to your branch**

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

#### **Step 1: Create the Graph File**
Create `06_graphs/graph.py` with these components:

**Required Classes:**
- `GraphNode` class with data and neighbors
- `Graph` class with adjacency list

**Required Methods:**
- `__init__()` - Initialize empty graph
- `add_node(data)` - Add new node to graph
- `add_edge(node1, node2)` - Add edge between nodes
- `remove_node(data)` - Remove node and its edges
- `remove_edge(node1, node2)` - Remove edge between nodes
- `get_neighbors(data)` - Get all neighbors of a node
- `has_edge(node1, node2)` - Check if edge exists
- `display()` - Print graph structure

**Key Requirements:**
- Support both directed and undirected graphs
- Handle duplicate nodes and edges
- Include docstrings with time/space complexity
- Implement adjacency list representation

#### **Step 2: Write Tests**
Create `06_graphs/tests/test_graph.py` with test cases for:
- Normal operations (add/remove nodes and edges)
- Edge cases (empty graph, single node)
- Graph properties (neighbors, edge existence)

#### **Step 3: Test Your Code**
```bash
# Run your graph implementation
python 06_graphs/graph.py

# Run your tests
python -m pytest 06_graphs/tests/test_graph.py -v
```

#### **Step 4: Commit and Push**
```bash
git checkout -b topic-6-graphs-representation
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement graph data structure

- Add GraphNode and Graph classes
- Implement adjacency list representation
- Add node and edge operations
- Support directed and undirected graphs"

git push origin topic-6-graphs-representation
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- âœ… All methods work correctly
- âœ… Tests pass (including edge cases)
- âœ… Proper graph structure maintenance
- âœ… Docstrings include complexity analysis
- âœ… Ready for PR creation

## Time Complexity Reference

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Add Node | O(1) | O(1) |
| Add Edge | O(1) | O(1) |
| Remove Node | O(V + E) | O(1) |
| Remove Edge | O(1) | O(1) |
| Get Neighbors | O(1) | O(1) |
| DFS | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| BFS | O(V + E) | O(V) |
