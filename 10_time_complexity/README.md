- Complexity comparison charts
- Performance visualization

#### **Step 3: Create Performance Tests**
Create `10_time_complexity/performance_tests.py` with:
- Timing different input sizes
- Complexity verification
- Performance comparison

#### **Step 4: Test Your Code**
```bash
# Run your complexity analysis
python 10_time_complexity/big_o_analysis.py

# Run your examples
python 10_time_complexity/examples.py

# Run performance tests
python 10_time_complexity/performance_tests.py
```

#### **Step 5: Commit and Push**
```bash
git checkout -b topic-10-time-complexity-big-o
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement Big O notation analysis

- Add examples for all major complexity classes
- Implement performance testing framework
- Add complexity comparison tools

- ‚úÖ Ready for PR creation

## Complexity Classes Reference

| Complexity | Notation | Example | Description |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Constant | O(1) | Array access | Time doesn't depend on input size |
| Logarithmic | O(log n) | Binary search | Time grows logarithmically |
| Linear | O(n) | Linear search | Time grows linearly with input |
| Linearithmic | O(n log n) | Merge sort | Time grows as n times log n |
| Quadratic | O(n¬≤) | Bubble sort | Time grows quadratically |
| Exponential | O(2‚Åø) | Recursive Fibonacci | Time grows exponentially |
