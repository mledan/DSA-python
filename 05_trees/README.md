## ðŸŽ¯ YOUR TASK: Complete Part 1 - Binary Tree Basics

### **What You Need to Do:**

1. **Create the binary tree file** (`05_trees/binary_tree.py`)
2. **Write comprehensive tests** (`05_trees/tests/test_binary_tree.py`)
3. **Test your implementation**
4. **Commit and push to your branch**

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

#### **Step 1: Create the Binary Tree File**
Create `05_trees/binary_tree.py` with these components:

**Required Classes:**
- `TreeNode` class with data, left, right attributes
- `BinaryTree` class with root pointer

**Required Methods:**
- `__init__()` - Initialize empty tree
- `insert(data)` - Insert new node
- `search(data)` - Find node with given data
- `height()` - Calculate tree height
- `size()` - Count total nodes
- `is_empty()` - Check if tree is empty
- `display()` - Print tree structure

**Key Requirements:**
- Handle empty tree operations
- Include docstrings with time/space complexity
- Implement basic tree operations

#### **Step 2: Write Tests**
Create `05_trees/tests/test_binary_tree.py` with test cases for:
- Normal operations (insert, search)
- Edge cases (empty tree, single node)
- Tree properties (height, size)

#### **Step 3: Test Your Code**
```bash
# Run your binary tree implementation
python 05_trees/binary_tree.py

# Run your tests
python -m pytest 05_trees/tests/test_binary_tree.py -v
```

#### **Step 4: Commit and Push**
```bash
git checkout -b topic-5-trees-binary-basic
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement basic binary tree

- Add TreeNode and BinaryTree classes
- Implement insert, search, height, size methods
- Add comprehensive test cases
- Handle empty tree operations"

git push origin topic-5-trees-binary-basic
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- âœ… All methods work correctly
- âœ… Tests pass (including edge cases)
- âœ… Proper tree structure maintenance
- âœ… Docstrings include complexity analysis
- âœ… Ready for PR creation

## Time Complexity Reference

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Insert | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| Search | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| Delete | O(log n) | O(log n) |
| Traversal | O(n) | O(h) |
